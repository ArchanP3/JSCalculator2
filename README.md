# JSCalculator2


**This code is for my Javascript Summaitve Calculator, I used various code for HTML and CSS to overall change the design and look of the calculator.
The Javscript part of this code is used to control the different functions of the calculator.

**I added some previous codes we did earlier in the semester to further enhanc my calculator, for exmaple I added in the WatzDiz App auto button.
